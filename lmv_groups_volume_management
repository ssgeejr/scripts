Use Case: You have a server with an existing logical group and logical volume and are attaching a replacing a drive with a different logical gorup and volume name. 
This will walk you through renaming those and remounting them

#Remove the group/volume you plan on replacing (these are the from a new server that we want to use the same group and volume names)
umount /opt/apps
vgchange -a n aalogvol
vgremove aaloggroup

#remove drive

#attach new drive with wrong parititon names
#rename your drives
lvrename aaloggroup xxlogvol aalogvol
vgrename aaloggroup aaloggroup

#mount 
mount /dev/aaloggroup/aalogvol /opt/apps
