it's easy to run a small VM out of disk space, when this happens, it's a true pain in the ass to assume root to clear up space. 
even sudo'ing to root fails ... to prevent this, create these two scripts and put them somewhere in your path

create-temp-space
```
#!/bin/bash

truncate -s 50M /tmp/recovery_space
```

recover-space-sudo
```
#!/bin/bash

rm -rf /tmp/recovery_space && sudo su -
```
